### Product Requirements Document (PRD): Personalized Meal Planner
---
### Goals and Background Context
* Build a user-centric meal planner application that simplifies weekly meal preparation.
* Develop a recommendation engine that provides inspiration and aligns with user preferences and goals.
* Create an optimized shopping list to minimize food waste.
* Establish a scalable, cloud-native architecture on Azure to support future growth and features.
* Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides clear value to the user while prioritizing core functionality.

**Background Context:**
Many people struggle with the time and effort required for meal planning, and existing tools often fall short in providing a personalized and inspiring experience. Our solution is designed to tackle these pain points directly. By leveraging a user-centric design and focusing on a data-driven approach, we aim to deliver a solution that not only meets a functional need but also changes user behavior by making healthy, efficient meal planning a more enjoyable process. Our approach is to focus on core features first to validate our key assumptions and then expand into more advanced capabilities, such as third-party integrations, as we grow.

### Requirements
#### Functional
* **FR1:** The user must be able to create a personal profile with dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan), allergies, and target macronutrient goals (e.g., high protein, low carb) during the initial onboarding process.
* **FR2:** The application must present a personalized meal plan for the upcoming week based on the user's profile and preferences.
* **FR3:** The user must be able to search for recipes by name, ingredients, cooking time, and macronutrient content.
* **FR4:** The application must display detailed recipe information, including a complete ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional facts.
* **FR5:** The user must be able to add or remove recipes from their weekly meal plan.
* **FR6:** The application must generate a single, consolidated shopping list from all the ingredients in the final weekly meal plan.
* **FR7:** The application must allow the user to adjust the number of servings for each recipe, and the ingredient quantities on the shopping list must update accordingly.
* **FR8:** The consolidated shopping list should be grouped into logical categories often found in stores such as vegetables, diary products, meat, cold storage items etc.
* **FR9:** The user should be able to rate (1-5 stars) and "favorite" the recipes they love.

#### Non-Functional
* **NFR1:** The application must be a web-based responsive application that functions on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **NFR2:** The entire solution must be built on cloud-native Azure services for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
* **NFR3:** The application's recommendation engine should be able to process a user's profile and generate a meal plan within 5 seconds.
* **NFR4:** The application must be scalable to handle at least 100 active users within the first year without significant performance degradation.
* **NFR5:** The application must be vendor-agnostic, with a modular design that supports integration with multiple grocery vendors in the future.
* **NFR6:** The user must be able to log in and access their profile securely using a standard authentication method.

### User Interface Design Goals
* **Overall UX Vision:** We want to build a user interface that is intuitive, inspiring, and feels like a personal, supportive guide. The user experience should feel effortless, reducing the cognitive load of meal planning.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The core interaction will be a seamless flow from a user's initial setup to a personalized weekly meal plan. We will prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface that provides a clear path for the user to search, select, and manage their recipes and meal plan.
* **Core User Journeys:**
    * A new user must be able to successfully complete the onboarding process and receive their first personalized meal plan.
    * A user must be able to find, select, and add a new recipe to their weekly meal plan.
    * A user must be able to view their weekly meal plan, customize it, and generate a final shopping list.
* **Accessibility:** We will aim for a minimal set of critical accessibility features for the MVP (e.g., clear color contrast, keyboard navigation) and set full WCAG AA compliance as a post-MVP goal.
* **Branding:** We will aim for a clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on high-quality food photography to provide inspiration.
* **Target Platforms:** The application should be a responsive web application that provides a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technical Assumptions
* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo.
    * **Rationale:** A monorepo simplifies dependency management and enables code sharing between the frontend and backend, which is a key requirement for a full-stack application. It also allows for easier atomic commits and versioning across the entire project.
* **Service Architecture:** Microservices on Azure Functions.
    * **Rationale:** Building on Azure Functions provides a serverless architecture that is highly scalable and cost-effective. It allows us to break down the application into small, independent services (e.g., a service for recipe management, a service for user profiles, a service for shopping lists). This approach also aligns with our goal of "starting small and scaling fast".
* **Testing Requirements:** Full Testing Pyramid (Unit + Integration + E2E).
    * **Rationale:** A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for ensuring a high-quality, reliable, and maintainable product. We will start with a focus on unit and integration tests and add end-to-end (E2E) tests for critical user journeys as the project matures.
* **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests:**
    * The front-end will be a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Vue, or Angular, with the final decision to be made during the architecture phase.
    * We will use a relational database, likely PostgreSQL, hosted on Azure.
    * We will use a standard authentication and authorization framework.
    * We will use a secure, scalable file storage solution for recipe images.
    * The infrastructure code must be written in Bicep, following the best practices outlined in the document: https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/bicep-code-best-practices.instructions.md.
    * The team must adhere to the instructions found at: https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/instructions/azure-functions-typescript.instructions.md.
