# User Interface Design Goals

* **Overall UX Vision:** We want to build a user interface that is intuitive, inspiring, and feels like a personal, supportive guide. The user experience should feel effortless, reducing the cognitive load of meal planning.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The core interaction will be a seamless flow from a user's initial setup to a personalized weekly meal plan. We will prioritize a clean, uncluttered interface that provides a clear path for the user to search, select, and manage their recipes and meal plan.
* **Core User Journeys:**
    * A new user must be able to successfully complete the onboarding process and receive their first personalized meal plan.
    * A user must be able to find, select, and add a new recipe to their weekly meal plan.
    * A user must be able to view their weekly meal plan, customize it, and generate a final shopping list.
* **Accessibility:** We will aim for a minimal set of critical accessibility features for the MVP (e.g., clear color contrast, keyboard navigation) and set full WCAG AA compliance as a post-MVP goal.
* **Branding:** We will aim for a clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on high-quality food photography to provide inspiration.
* **Target Platforms:** The application should be a responsive web application that provides a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
