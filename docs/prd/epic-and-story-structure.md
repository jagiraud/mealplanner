    * **Story 1.1: Project Setup & Authentication:**
        * **As a** Developer,
        * **I want** a scaffolded project with a working authentication system,
        * **so that** I can begin building features on a secure and organized foundation.
        * **Acceptance Criteria:**
            1. The project is initialized as a monorepo with separate packages for the frontend and backend.
            2. A basic serverless function is deployed to Azure with a public-facing API endpoint.
            3. The project includes a working user registration and login system.
            4. A new user can successfully register and log in to the application.
        * **Tasks / Subtasks:**
            * Initialize the monorepo project structure.
            * Set up a backend package with Azure Functions.
            * Implement the user registration and login endpoints.
            * Configure a relational database on Azure to store user data.
            * Implement a service to handle secure password hashing and storage.
    * **Story 1.2: User Profile Management:**
        * **As a** returning user,
        * **I want** to manage my personal information,

            1. A user can view and edit their profile details after logging in.
            2. The application stores dietary preferences, allergies, and macronutrient goals for each user.
            3. The user can save their profile changes, and the changes are persisted in the database.
            4. The system validates user input to ensure data integrity.
        * **Tasks / Subtasks:**
            * Create API endpoints for retrieving and updating user profile data.
            * Implement the front-end user profile page.
