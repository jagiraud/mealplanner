# Goals and Background Context

* Build a user-centric meal planner application that simplifies weekly meal preparation.
* Develop a recommendation engine that provides inspiration and aligns with user preferences and goals.
* Create an optimized shopping list to minimize food waste.
* Establish a scalable, cloud-native architecture on Azure to support future growth and features.
* Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides clear value to the user while prioritizing core functionality.

**Background Context:**
Many people struggle with the time and effort required for meal planning, and existing tools often fall short in providing a personalized and inspiring experience. Our solution is designed to tackle these pain points directly. By leveraging a user-centric design and focusing on a data-driven approach, we aim to deliver a solution that not only meets a functional need but also changes user behavior by making healthy, efficient meal planning a more enjoyable process. Our approach is to focus on core features first to validate our key assumptions and then expand into more advanced capabilities, such as third-party integrations, as we grow.
